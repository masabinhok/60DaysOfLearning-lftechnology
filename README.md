# #60DaysOfLearning-lftechnology

Welcome to my #60DaysOfLearning journey with LF Technology! This repository documents my progress and learnings over 60 days as I enhance my web development skills, focusing on JavaScript and version control.

## Days 1-4: JavaScript Foundations Set

During the first four days, I solidified my understanding of JavaScript fundamentals after completing a comprehensive course. This foundational knowledge will be crucial as I move on to building projects and further enhancing my skills.

## Day 5: Git Refresh

On Day 5, I took the opportunity to refresh my knowledge of Git by enrolling in META's Git course on Coursera. This course provides an introduction to version control, which is essential for managing code changes and collaborating on projects. You can check out the course [here](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-to-version-control).

## Day 6: Built Billify

On Day 6, I built "Billify," a bill generating app, to dive into DOM manipulation. This project helped me apply JavaScript in a practical scenario and improved my understanding of how to interact with the Document Object Model.

## Looking Forward

I'm excited to dive into the practical application of the skills I've learned and to continue building my web development expertise. Stay tuned for more updates and projects as I progress through my #60DaysOfLearning!
